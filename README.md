# Cucumber Project

This project showcases end-to-end test coverage and easy display with a given feature file. It aims to showcase multiple Selenium tests utilizing Behavior-Driven Development.

## BDD
BDD is a methodology in testing where project managers, developers, and testers all are on the path of the same vision in terms of a specific software project. 

Keypoints:
- Driving behavior first (utilizing plain-text and readable feature files) supports collaboration and Gherkin files.
- Focuses on deriving scenerios before code as to set out the project outputs first.
- There is a lot of collaboration with English, like tests and active logging of feature files of results and what has been tested.

**Benefits**
- Iteration and collaboration.
- Gherkin plain English files

## TDD
TDD is another methodology that focuses on Red-Green-Refactor, which promotes:
- Writing failed initial tests
- Creating the minimum code to pass the test
- Clean the code while keeping tests passing

**Benefits**
- Unit level test coverage
- Excellent code coverage

Both BDD and TDD are complementary and are used either for software behaviour testing and showcase or unit level tests

## BDD vs TDD with the Testing Pyramid
     (Top) End-to-end Testing - TDD
     (Middle) Integration testing
     (Bottom) Unit tests - BDD

At the bottom, we focus on unit-level tests, which are fast, reliable, and cheap to run. \n
At the top, we have end-to-end application testing, which focuses on expensive but very high confidence in software behavior.
